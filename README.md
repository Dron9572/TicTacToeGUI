Tic Tac Toe is a classic pencil and paper game transformed into a digital GUI game. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where two players take turns marking either an "X" or an "O" in the empty squares. The goal is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line with your three symbols. 

This version of the game is designed for two players to enjoy competitive gameplay.

Additionally, this game was developed using standard tools in the Visual Studio environment.

Features of this version include sound effects for various events, such as drawing crosses and circles, winning or drawing sounds, and the use of graphical rendering of shapes instead of simple symbol inserts.
